The output folder contains the outputs of R code files in "code/featurization code" folder. These outputs records the classification errors in the case study Section 3.2. More specifically,

1. "logistic_m1.Rdata", "forest_m1.Rdata", "svm_m1.Rdata":  the outputs of the R code file "M.1 feature.R" with respect to the M.1 featurization method.

1. "logistic_m2.Rdata", "forest_m2.Rdata", "svm_m2.Rdata":  the outputs of the R code file "M.2 feature.R" with respect to the M.2 featurization method.

1. "logistic_m3.Rdata", "forest_m3.Rdata", "svm_m3.Rdata":  the outputs of the R code file "M.3 feature.R" with respect to the M.3 featurization method.

1. "logistic_m4.Rdata", "forest_m4.Rdata", "svm_m4.Rdata":  the outputs of the R code file "M.4 feature.R" with respect to the M.4 featurization method.

The manuscript summarizes these case study results in Table 1 and Figure 6 in Section 3.2. The R code to produce the table and figure,"Table 1 results.R" and "Figure 6 results.R", are available in the files located at the "code" folder.
